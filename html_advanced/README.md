# HTML Semantic Structure Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a webpage from a designer file with a focus on building a **semantic HTML structure** without any styling (CSS). The goal is to understand and implement the correct HTML5 tags to create a well-structured, accessible, and SEO-friendly webpage.

The HTML code is carefully crafted to follow best practices for web development, ensuring that the content is meaningful and the structure is clear.

## Project Requirements

- **Semantic HTML Elements:** Usage of semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.
- **Accessibility:** The webpage should be accessible to screen readers by using appropriate HTML5 tags and attributes.
- **SEO-Friendly:** Proper use of headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create a logical and hierarchical structure of the content, improving search engine optimization.
- **Clean and Readable Code:** Write well-organized and easy-to-read HTML code, following best practices and using comments where necessary.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Designer File

The layout of the webpage is based on a designer file provided as part of the project. This file acts as a blueprint to create the HTML structure.
